"""Regression test: `reflowfy test` must send per job, not merge and send once.

A pipeline with docs_per_job=1 (here: MockSource(batch_size=1)) splits into
one job per record. The destination must receive one send per job — the
same as production (PipelineRunner -> LocalDispatcher -> WorkerExecutor) —
not one send for the whole batch merged together.
